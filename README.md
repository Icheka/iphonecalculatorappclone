# iphonecalculatorappclone
The iPhone Calculator app clone is my answer to the question: "what would an iOS application look like if Apple's original proposal for implementing installable apps in their iPhones had not been waived?" The iPhone Calculator clone looks and works a lot like the original iOS app. In future updates, I will make it completely available for use offline.
